Brief Description of Each Directory:
.vscode/: Contains Visual Studio Code specific settings. The settings.json file can be configured for your development environment.

.github/workflows/: Holds GitHub Actions workflows, such as unittests.yml, which is used to automatically run unit tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

.gitignore: Lists files and directories that Git should ignore. This usually includes environment files, build artifacts, and other files that should not be version controlled.

requirements.txt: Specifies the Python libraries and packages required to run the project. You can install these dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

src/: This is where the main source code for the project resides. The __init__.py file makes this directory a package.

notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimentation. The README.md provides guidelines for working within this directory.

tests/: This directory is dedicated to unit and integration tests. The __init__.py file allows you to organize and run tests as a package.

scripts/: Holds various scripts used for data processing, analysis, or other automation tasks. The README.md here explains how to use these scripts.
